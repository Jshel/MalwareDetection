See Malware_Journal_Experiment_Overview.pdf for a description of the experimental setup and data collection.

Under each directory is a subfolder for ETB - Embedded Trace Buffer data and HPC - Hardware Performance Counter data.

Each ETB folder has 5 runs of ETB data (the same program was rerun 5 times with ETB collection to ensure consistency).

Each HPC folder has 5 runs of 5 frequencies of data (625,1250,2500,5000, and 10000 Hz). The naming of the file indicates the frequency and the run number for the file.
